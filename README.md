# StoryCoin (STC)

## Rewriting the economics of reading

What is writing worth? What about your time reading?

The fact is that these days neither is worth anything. Words are now free, easy to copy and distribute as much as you want. When reputation is the new data, showing clearly your worth as an author is everything

StoryCoin is a way to put a better value on the words you write and time you spend reading. It reintroduces scarcity and thus provides measurable and exchangeable value. Decentralised and interoperable protocol of writing and reading value.

## How it would work

### Writing

![alt text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/495102/40749380-b7786fa2-645b-11e8-83f9-3fd1aa58d594.png) 

The Author writes a 2000 word article

### Publishing

The Author publishes the article, pushing it first to the StoryCoin open ledger and then to a website with a WordPress plugin or Javascript on the page.

### The Article

The article on the website shows that it has been put on the open ledger, its ID hash and how much StoryCoin (STC) it has earned.

### The Leaderboard

The Reader goes to check the leaderboard of StoryCoin articles and can see which have the highest value, by author or article, etc. The Reader chooses to read an article which takes him to what the Author has written.

### Reading

The Reader reads the page, seeing how much StoryCoin (STC) he’s paying to read the article. They are charged on a curve, meaning that it allows the reader to not be charged a lot at the beginning, and encouraging the Author to create good stories to the end. In this case, the Reader has only read 4.5 minutes. They would be charged by either the length or price, whichever is less.

### Value

The article has earned the Author 100,000 STC. A publisher sees how popular the article is and is interested in licensing it or buying the article.

The total earned value of the article that the Author has written is also on the open ledger. Likewise, the ledger can record any transactions of that article, allowing the Author to license or sell it.

### Buying and selling

The Author sells the article to the Buyer and the transaction is recorded on the open ledger.


## How this works for authors:

- You earn coins, not random stars or page views all over the internet, that are not tied to any platform and that are completely transparent. Likes and follows don’t mean anyone has actually read the work or how much
- You get ‘paid’ in an exchange with your readers
- StoryCoins you earn are exchangeable for other cryptocurrencies
- The coins are finite and so can be bought or exchanged and so would go up in value
- IP and ownership is open, transparent and verifiable

## How this works for readers:

- Readers pay authors for their work with a measurable amount of their attention
- There are no ads
- Have a transferable measure of time and reading
